Rock Paper Scissors



Write a program that is similar to the popular game titled “Rock-Paper-Scissors.”
The program randomly generates the number of 1, 2, or 3 with 1 being Rock, 2 
being Paper, and 3 being Scissors. Then, the program is to prompt the user to 
enter a value of 1, 2, or 3. Next, the program displays a clear readable message 
displaying both the computer’s selection, the user’s selection, and the results.
